# 16-bit CPU Design with I/O Interface

## Overview
This project represents the culmination of advanced concepts in computer architecture, focusing on the design of a 16-bit CPU with an integrated I/O interface module. It simulates the essential components of a computer system and their interconnections, providing a hands-on approach to understanding the CPU's operation and control mechanisms.

## Features
- Simulated 16-bit CPU design.
- Hardwired control unit implementation.
- Integrated data unit with memory and registers.
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for basic computations.
- Simple input/output interface with switches and LED indicators.

## How to Use
- Use the `.circ` file to open the project in Logisim.
- Review the `16-bit CPU.docx` for a detailed report and project insights.
- Right click the `RAM Module` and press on `Load Image`. Here, select `add.txt` to load the pre-made assembly code. 
- Simulate the CPU's operation and observe the I/O interactions.

## Prerequisites
- [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) for running `.circ` files.
- A document viewer for `.docx` files.

## Contributing
Contributors can enhance the project by refining the CPU design, adding more complex I/O operations, or expanding the instruction set. Please fork the project, make your improvements, and submit a pull request.
